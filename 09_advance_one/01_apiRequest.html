    // XMLHttpRequest() :- are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.

    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
    // created the object.The constructor initializes an XMLHttpRequest. It must be called before any other method calls.

    xhr.open('Get',requestUrl); 
    // first we enter the get,post,send payload etc in the request
    
    // to track the change in state we use "" .readyState "" and to continiously track the changes in the state we  use "" onreadystatechange ""
    // as the state change this function executes
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        console.log(xhr.readyState);

        if(xhr.readyState === 4){
            const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); 
            // this.responseText is the json data so we need to parse this json data into object type to access its elements that is only possible through parsing it into object type

            console.log(typeof data);
            console.log(data);
            console.log(data.name);
        }
    }

    // after writing open() it don't automatically get called so we need
    xhr.send()

    // when we send the request the status code changes 

// ___________________________________________________________________________________________________

// console.log is the browser dubegging tool , javascript contain some arithmetic operation some loops etc , like document.   operation this are all injected by the runtime of the javascript 

// javascript work through the Runtime environment like nodeJs , with the Browser... nodeJs is also the implementation of V8 Engine and whole engine is also written in C++ , javascript also runs with the C++ 
// V8 engine also gives you lot of debugging tools, api access
